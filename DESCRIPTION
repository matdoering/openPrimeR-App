Description: A Shiny application providing methods for designing, evaluating,
    and comparing primer sets for multiplex polymerase chain reaction.
    Primers are designed by solving a set cover problem such that
    the number of covered template sequences is maximized with
    the smallest possible set of primers.
    To guarantee that high-quality primers are generated,
    only primers fulfilling constraints on their physicochemical properties 
    are selected.
